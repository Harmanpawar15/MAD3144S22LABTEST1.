        <td>Beagles are active, curious dogs. They are also hound dogs, so it's in their nature to roam. Care must be taken to prevent them from wandering off into harm's way by keeping them contained in a fenced-in yard or on a leash when outside of the house. Beagles also are friendly little dogs..</td>
